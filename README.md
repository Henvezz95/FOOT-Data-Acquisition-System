# FOOT-Data-Acquisition-System
![FOOT](./Images/FOOT.png?raw=true)

Bachelor Thesis Project aimed at developing the VHDL part of a Data Acquisition System. The system was designed to be used in the FOOT (FragmentatiOn Of Target) experiment.
The FOOT experiment aims to provide precise nuclear cross-section measurements for two different fields: hadrontherapy and radio-protectionin space. 

The DAQ System used in the real life experiments uses this code (with a few incremental updates) to collect and organize data coming from the sensors.
